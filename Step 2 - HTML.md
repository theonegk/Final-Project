# Step 2 - HTML

Before we dive into coding away our first website we must first understand what HTML is.

**From [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)**
- *HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.*
- *HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language*
- *HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup*
- *HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages*
- *HTML elements are represented by tags*
- *HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on*
- *Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page*

Now that we have a basic understanding of what HTML is, let's dive into the coding aspect of it.
